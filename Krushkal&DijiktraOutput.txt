Krushkals output

Heuristic is used for helping to choose the next edge. If the heuristic value is low, the edge is preferred.
Enter the number of vertices: 4
Enter the number of edges: 5
Enter the edges in the format: u v weight heuristic
0 1 10 2

2 3 4 0
1 2 6 1

Edges in the constructed MST:
2 -- 3 == 4
0 -- 3 == 5

Dijiktra's output

Here we look for neighbors of node and select the neighbor with lowest heuristic value.
Enter the number of vertices: 5
Enter the adjacency matrix (0 for no edge):
Row 0: 0 1 1 0 0
Row 1: 0 0 0 1 0
Row 2: 0 0 0 1 1
Row 3: 0 0 0 0 1
Row 4: 0 0 0 0 0

Enter heuristic values for each vertex:
Heuristic for vertex 0: 5
Heuristic for vertex 1: 3
Heuristic for vertex 2: 2
Heuristic for vertex 3: 4
Heuristic for vertex 4: 1

Enter the source vertex: 0
Enter the goal vertex: 4

Path Taken (Greedy Best First Search):
