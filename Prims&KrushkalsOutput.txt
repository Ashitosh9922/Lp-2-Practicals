Prims Output

Heuristic is used for helping to choose the next edge. If the heuristic values are lower, they are preferred.

Enter the number of vertices: 4

Enter the graph as an adjacency matrix (use 0 for no edge):
Row 0: 0 2 0 6
Row 1: 2 0 3 8
Row 2: 0 3 0 0
Row 3: 6 8 0 0

Enter heuristic values for each vertex:
Heuristic value for vertex 0: 1
Heuristic value for vertex 1: 3
Heuristic value for vertex 2: 2
Heuristic value for vertex 3: 4

Enter the source vertex (0 to V-1): 0


Krushkals output

Heuristic is used for helping to choose the next edge. If the heuristic value is low, the edge is preferred.
Enter the number of vertices: 4
